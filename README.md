# json-path-comparison
Comparison of the different implementations of JSONPath.

Our goals is to show features of [JSONPath](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/)
in available libraries, and call out differences where libraries are not aligned.

See <comparison/README.md> for a table generated against a set of example queries.
