Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/comparison):

- [ ] `$[-1:]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  "third"
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  "first"
  ```

- [ ] `$.key`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": ["first", "second"]}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [["first", "second"]]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/JavaScript_jsonpath-plus.
