Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/comparison):

- [ ] `$[:]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: "$[:]\n^^^^\n"', src/libcore/result.rs:997:5
  note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Rust_jsonpath_lib.
