Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value", {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, "string", [0, 1], 0, 1]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [{"another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, "key": "value"}, "value", {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, "string", [0, 1], 0, 1]
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [[40, null, 42], 40, null, 42]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_galbar-jsonpath.
