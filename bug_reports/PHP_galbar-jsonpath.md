Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [[40, null, 42], 40, null, 42]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_galbar-jsonpath.
