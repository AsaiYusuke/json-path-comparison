Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[?(@.key>42 && @.key<44)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    {
      "key": 42
    },
    {
      "key": 43
    },
    {
      "key": 44
    }
  ]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"key": 43}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  FormatException: end of input expected at 1:2. Expression: $[?(@.key>42 && @.key<44)]
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.key>43 || @.key<43)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    {
      "key": 42
    },
    {
      "key": 43
    },
    {
      "key": 44
    }
  ]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"key": 42}, {"key": 44}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  FormatException: end of input expected at 1:2. Expression: $[?(@.key>43 || @.key<43)]
  ```

- [ ] `$[*,1]`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
    "forth",
    "fifth"
  ]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
    "forth",
    "fifth",
    "second"
  ]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Dart_json_path.
