Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$.key-dash`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "key-dash": "value"
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  ```

- [ ] `$.-1`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
    "forth",
    "fifth"
  ]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  []
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Golang_github.com-ohler55-ojg.
