Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$['two.some']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"one": {"key": "value"}, "two": {"some": "more", "key": "other value"}, "two.some": "42"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["42"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["more"]
  ```

- [ ] `$[-1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$['.']`
  Input:
  ```
  {".": "value", "another": "entry"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [{".": "value", "another": "entry"}]
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.key<42)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": 42}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 43}, {"key": 42.0001}, {"key": 41.9999}, {"key": 100}, {"some": "value"}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 41.9999}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 41.9999}, {"some": "value"}]
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.key)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"some": "some value"}, {"key": "value"}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"key": "value"}]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  String 'value' was not recognized as a valid Boolean.
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/dotNET_JsonPathLib.
