Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[::2]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "third", "fifth"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  init terminating in do_boot ({badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,syntax error before: ':'}}})
  
  Crash dump is being written to: /dev/null...done
  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ","':'"]}}}}
  ```

- [ ] `$.2`
  Input:
  ```
  {"a": "first", "2": "second", "b": "third"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  init terminating in do_boot ({badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,syntax error before: 2}}})
  
  Crash dump is being written to: /dev/null...done
  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ",["2"]]}}}}
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Erlang_ejsonpath.
