Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$.*[1]`
  Input:
  ```
  [[1], [2, 3]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [3]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  ** (Enum.OutOfBoundsError) The query should be resolved to scalar value but the index 1 is out of bounds for emum [1].
      lib/jsonpath.ex:9: Mix.Tasks.Execute.run/1
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Elixir_warpath.
