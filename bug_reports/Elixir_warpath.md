Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[0]`
  Input:
  ```
  "Hello World"
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  null
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Warpath.JsonDecodeError
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.d in [2, 3])]`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    {
      "d": 1
    },
    {
      "d": 2
    },
    {
      "d": 1
    },
    {
      "d": 3
    },
    {
      "d": 4
    }
  ]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    {
      "d": 2
    },
    {
      "d": 3
    }
  ]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Elixir_warpath.
