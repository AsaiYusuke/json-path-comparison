Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$.in`
  Input:
  ```
  {"in": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  "value"
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  ** (Warpath.ExpressionError) Parser error: Invalid token on line 1, syntax error before: in_op
      lib/jsonpath.ex:9: Mix.Tasks.Execute.run/1
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Elixir_warpath.
