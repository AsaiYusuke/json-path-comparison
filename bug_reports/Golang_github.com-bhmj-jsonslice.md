The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath

  Input:
  ```
  [[1, 2], ["a", "b"], [0, 0]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```

  Input:
  ```
  [{"bar": [42]}]

  [42]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [[42]]
  ```

- [ ] `$..[*]`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["string", "value", 0, 1, [0, 1], {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```

- [ ] `$.key-dash`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key-dash": "value"}
