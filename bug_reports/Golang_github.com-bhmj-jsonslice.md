Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$['two.some']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"one": {"key": "value"}, "two": {"some": "more", "key": "other value"}, "two.some": "42"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["42"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  "42"
  ```

- [ ] `$[*].bar[*].baz`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"bar": [{"baz": "hello"}]}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["hello"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [["hello"]]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Golang_github.com-bhmj-jsonslice.
