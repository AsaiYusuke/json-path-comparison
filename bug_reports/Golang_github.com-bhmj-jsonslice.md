Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[4,1]`
  Input:
  ```
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [5, 2]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [2, 5]
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:2][*]`
  Input:
  ```
  [[1, 2], ["a", "b"], [0, 0]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [1, 2, "a", "b"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [[1, 2], ["a", "b"]]
  ```

- [ ] `$[*].bar[*].baz`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"bar": [{"baz": "hello"}]}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["hello"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [["hello"]]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Golang_github.com-bhmj-jsonslice.
