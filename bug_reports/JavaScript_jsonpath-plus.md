Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[-1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$[0:0]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  []
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```

- [ ] `$['@']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"@": "value", "another": "entry"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```

  ```

- [ ] `$['$']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"$": "value", "another": "entry"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [{"$": "value", "another": "entry"}]
  ```

- [ ] `$['*']`
  Input:
  ```

  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["value", "entry"]

For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/JavaScript_jsonpath-plus.
