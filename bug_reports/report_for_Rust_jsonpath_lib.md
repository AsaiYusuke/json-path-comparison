Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/comparison):

- [ ] `$[*]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Rust_jsonpath_lib.
