Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[::]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Expected slice step at line 1 and column 5
  ```

- [ ] `$[-4:]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$[1:3:]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second", "third"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Expected slice step at line 1 and column 7
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Cpp_jsoncons.
