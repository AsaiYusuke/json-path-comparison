Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[1:3]`
  Input:
  ```
  {":": 42, "more": "string", "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  []
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["string", 1]
  ```

- [ ] `$[2:1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  []
  ```
  Error:
  ```

  ```

- [ ] `$[-4:]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Number was less than the array's lower bound in the first dimension. (Parameter 'sourceIndex')
  ```

- [ ] `$['one','three'].key`
  Input:
  ```
  {"one": {"key": "value"}, "two": {"k": "v"}, "three": {"some": "more", "key": "other value"}}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value", "other value"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Expected close bracket. Path up to error: '$'
  ```

- [ ] `$[0]['c','d']`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"c": "cc1", "d": "dd1", "e": "ee1"}, {"c": "cc2", "d": "dd2", "e": "ee2"}]
  ```

  ["cc1", "dd1"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Expected close bracket. Path up to error: '$[0]'
  ```
