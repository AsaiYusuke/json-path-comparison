      3
    ],
    1,

  ]
  ```
  Error:
  ```

- [ ] `$(key,more)`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "key": 1,
    "some": 2,
    "more": 3
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    {
      "key": 1,
      "more": 3,
      "some": 2
    }
  ]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Rust_jsonpath_lib.
