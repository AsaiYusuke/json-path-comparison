Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[?(@[1]=='b')]`
  Input:
  ```
  [["a", "b"], ["x", "y"]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [["a", "b"]]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Rust_jsonpath_lib.
